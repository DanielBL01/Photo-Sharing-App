### Notes (This is a Backend project)
**Because of many issues with Git and Heroku CLI, there were many unnecessary commits so I decided to make a new git repo with all the files of this project. Unfortunately, I've lost many of my commits however some key features to the website that I've built include**: 
- Custom User Model
- Relational Database
- User Authentication (Signup, Login, Logout)
- CRUD
- Image rendering
- Search filter
- User comments
