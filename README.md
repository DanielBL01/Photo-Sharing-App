### Notes
Because of many issues with Django and Heroku, there were many unnecessary commits so I decided to make a new git repo. Unfortunately, I've lost many of my commits however some key features to the website that I've built include: 
- Custom User Model
- User Authentication (Signup, Login, Logout)
- CRUD
- Image rendering
- Search filter
- User comments
